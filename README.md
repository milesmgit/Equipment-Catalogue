# Equipment-Catalogue
Equipment Catalogue Manager for a MMORPG



 the purpose of this project will be to create a dataset, read(import) the dataset 
 into this program so that specific items may be searched according to various
 item attributes, input from the user.  Then the results of the search will be
 persisted to a database so that the user may return to the data at a later time.
 The utility to the user will be that of making it easier to decide which gear to 
 don based upon current player character attributes possessed or missing.
 It will be much easier to design an optimum character for future use if the 
 equipment gearset is known.

To run the program, download and open the .sln file in Visual Studio.  The instructions for how to use the program are on screen, in console.
